suggestions for improvement:
- The `get_visible_items` method only returns the current index instead of the visible items, which is incorrect.
- The `items = []` assignment within `__init__` should be `self.items = []`.
- Navigation methods are missing.
- Error handling for `go_to_page` is missing.
Brief justification:
- correctness: The code defines the `Pagination` class and its `__init__` method as described in steps 1 and 2. However, `get_visible_items` is not correctly implemented, returning only the index. Navigation methods are not implemented. Therefore, the correctness is low. The item list should be initiated with `self.items = []`.
- readability: The code is reasonably well-structured and easy to follow, with comments indicating the steps being implemented, but it's incomplete. Variable names are clear.
- performance: The `__init__` method calculates `total_pages`, which is good for performance.  There are no performance issues in the existing code.
- security: There are no apparent security concerns in the provided code.
