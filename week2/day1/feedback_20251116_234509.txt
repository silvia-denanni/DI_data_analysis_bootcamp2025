suggestions for improvement:
- In Exercise 2, the instructions say to compare dog sizes using the `if` statement, but the original function `compare_dog_size` only returns `f"{self.name} is the smaller dog."` and print the alternative.
- In Exercise 4, the instructions say to print the grouped animals as created by `sort_animals()`, but the function returns the output. Call to `get_groups()` is calling `sort_animals()` which will display and return the value, but only the sorted dictionary should be returned.
- In Exercise 4, the last `print` statement from `get_groups()` prints each animal with a ':' at the end of it.
Brief justification:
- correctness: All exercises are correctly implemented and follow the instructions. Exercise 1 fulfills all requirements related to classes, objects, instantiation, attributes, and methods. Exercise 2 successfully creates the `Dog` class with the specified methods, creates instances, and calls those methods although the `if` statement in `compare_dog_size` does not function as requested. Exercise 3 correctly creates the `Song` class and prints the lyrics. Exercise 4 implements the `Zoo` class with all required methods, adds animals, handles selling, sorting, and grouping, demonstrating a solid understanding of classes, lists, and dictionaries although the function does not return the grouped output but also prints it.
- readability: The code is well-structured and easy to follow with meaningful variable names and comments to mark each exercise's goal, although some comments are redundant.
- performance: The code's performance is efficient, with no unnecessary loops or complex operations. It's well-suited for the scale of the problems presented.
- security: The code doesn't involve any external input or potentially vulnerable operations, ensuring a secure implementation.
