suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding a docstring to each function to explain its purpose and arguments.
- The player input validation could be slightly improved by using a try-except block to handle non-integer inputs, although the current validation fulfills the task's requirements.
- The player switching logic can be simplified using the ternary operator (current_player = 'O' if current_player == 'X' else 'X').
Brief justification:
- correctness: The code accurately implements all the required functionalities: representing the board, displaying it, getting player input with validation, checking for a winner, checking for a tie, and managing the main game loop. It directly addresses all the steps outlined in the problem description.
- readability: The code is generally well-structured and easy to follow. Variable names are descriptive, and the code is adequately commented. However, adding docstrings would further enhance readability.
- performance: The code's performance is satisfactory for a simple Tic Tac Toe game. The algorithms used are efficient enough for the scale of the problem. There are no unnecessary loops or complex operations.
- security: The code does not involve any external input or potentially vulnerable operations, so there are no security concerns.
