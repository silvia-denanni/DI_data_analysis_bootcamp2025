Brief justification:
- correctness: The code accurately addresses both challenges as described in the chapter content, returning correctly sorted words and identifying the longest word in a sentence. Every step is covered and the expected outputs are achieved.
- readability: The code is well-formatted, uses descriptive variable names, and includes comments that explain the purpose of each section. Function names are appropriately chosen.
- performance: The code uses efficient built-in functions like `split()` and `sort()`, and the loop in `find_longest_word()` iterates only once through the words. Therefore, the performance is good.
- security: The code uses the `input()` function, but it does not evaluate the input in any way that could lead to code injection. Therefore, the security risks are minimal.
