suggestions for improvement:
- The search item function was added, however it was not included in the main menu as option 6 as intended and shown in the example.
Brief justification:
- correctness: The code almost completely fulfills the requirements. The functions are implemented as described, and the main loop functions as expected. The program handles invalid input and edge cases such as item not found/already exists. There is a search_item function however it is never used in the main program loop. This is a deviation from the requirements.
- readability: The code is well-formatted and easy to read. Variable names are descriptive, and comments are used effectively to explain the purpose of each function and section of code.
- performance: The code is efficient and performs well for the given task. The dictionary data structure allows for fast lookups and updates.
- security: The code does not have any obvious security vulnerabilities. The input is validated to prevent negative prices, but more robust input validation could be added to prevent other types of errors.
