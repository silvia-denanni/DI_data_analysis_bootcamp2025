# DI-Bootcamp-nov25

working on the file in my pc
git recognize the changes in my files (it does it automatically)

go to Source Control --> Changes (accordion), all of the modifications that I performed on my file; press
on "+" to send the file to Stage (it creates a "screenshot" of the changes)

before pushing the changes to the cloud (GitHub) you have to add a comment -->Commit ; after that
press --> Sync Changes to finalize the publication.

## CLI COMMANDS (Command Line)

git status

git add . --> it will add everything to stage area (if not everything, just write "fileName" instead of the ".")

git commit -m "" --> inside the "" you need to write your comment (what you did, as a log)

git push --> push to the cloud on GitHub
